<h3>PREFACE</h3>
<p>Spontaneous development of the human civilization has been accompanied by a continuous increase of impact of environment, and first 
of all on live nature In the twentieth century this pressure exceeded the admissible level, destruction of natural ecosystems and 
environment pollution acquired such a scale that they have started to clearly affect indicators of global environmental 
characteristics, and particularly the rate of changing these indicators Along with such anthropogenic processes as shifts in the 
atmosphere chemical content (increase in concentration of greenhouse gases) and thinning of the ozone stratum, rather hazardous 
tendencies also include desertification, downsizing of forests and biological diversity.</p>
<p>Pressure of the civilization on the live nature has led to exclusively high (unprecedented in the history of the Earth) rate of 
extinction of species (and subspecies) of animals, plants and fungi The hazard of biological diversity downsizing is often viewed from 
the economic point of view (downsizing of the genetic pool decreases the opportunities in the area of biotechnology development), 
based on ethic, esthetic, social and pedagogical principles These are very important aspects, but a more important aspect is that 
biodiversity downsizing is a sign of biota degradation, hazard of destruction of natural mechanisms for environment stabilization, 
destruction of the environmental balance, neanng of the environmental catastrophe.</p>
<p>Preservation of the genetic pool of live creatures, and first of all endangered species (i e the part of biota that is the most 
vulnerable from the point of view of biological diversity) is one of the mam tasks of environment protection
In accordance with current legislation, rare and endangered species of animals, plants and fungi are included in the Red Data Books of 
the Russian Federation and of the Subjects of the Russian Federation Inclusion in the Red Data Book is a legal act (formalizing sign) 
imposing constraints on relevant species as objects of legal protection from other representatives of flora and fauna The 
organizational and legal guaranties increasing opportunities in the area of conservation and rehabilitation are effective in relation 
to the species included in the Red Data Book.</p>
<p>Maintenance of the Red Data Book of the Russian Federation is a continuous work on monitoring of rare and endangered species and on 
implementation of the above organizational and legal guarantees The present edition summarizes this work for the last fifteen years 
after its first edition</p>
<p>The role of the Red Data Book of the Russian Federation as a popular scientific reference-book is significant It includes data on 
those aspects of biology of rare and endangered species that reflect causes of their rareness and extinction, constraints that 
substantiate these phenomena, areas of activities that facilitate conservation of these species I would like also to note that 
conservation of rare and endangered species (and equally those species that fortunately are not currently endangered) is possible only 
in case of preservation, rehabilitation, expansion of those ecosystems where they live, necessary elements of which they are and to 
which their genetic programs are oriented.</p>
<p>The proposed edition is a result of joint work of many scientists and highly-qualified specialists of central and regional scientific 
institutions, higher educational institutes, legislative and executive authorities I am sure that this work is necessary for 
preservation of nature of Russia.</p>

<p>The Red Data Book of the Russian Federation includes rare and endangered animals, plants and fungi that permanently or temporarily 
live under conditions of natural freedom at the territory, continental shelf and in the marine economic zone of the Russian Federation 
and that need special state legal activities within competence of federal executive authorities The Red Data Book of the Russian 
Federation is meeting the obligation of the Russian Federation assumed in accordance with the Convention on Biological Diversity 
approved in 1992 in Rio-de-Janeiro.</p>
<p>The Red Data Book of the Russian Federation that includes fauna objects (the Red Data Book of RSFSR) was for the first time published 
in 1983 The Department of Hunting and Protected Areas under the Council of Ministers of the Russian Federation (Glavokhota RSFSR) 
prepared and published this edition The Central Hunting and Protected Areas Scientific and Research Laboratory of Glavokhota RSFSR 
(CNIL Glavokhota RSFSR, at present State Agency "Control Information and Analytical Center for Hunted Animals and Their Habitats" of 
the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Supplies of Russia) with attraction of zoologists of Russian academic and other leading research 
institutions provided scientific support.</p>
<p>In accordance with the applicable civil laws, the Red Data Book should be published at least once per ten years Compilation and 
agreement of the lists of fauna objects to be included in the Red Data Book were continued practically right after publication of the 
Red Data Book of RSFSR in 1983 CNIL Glavokhota RSFSR collected a considerable part of materials for preparation of essays on species 
for the Red Data Book Further developments in the country introduced significant changes in the commenced work The preparation of the 
final version of the Red Data Book of the Russian Federation and its publication were realized by A N Severtsov Institute of Ecology 
and Evolution of the Russian Academy of Sciences.</p>
<p>After establishing a system of environmental agencies in 1988, the function for maintenance of the Red Data Book of the Russian 
Federation was transferred to the Ministry of Nature of Russia The Russian Academy of Sciences and the Russian Scientific and Research 
Institute of Nature Protection realize the provision of scientific support for it In 1992 the Commission for Rare and Endangered 
Animals, Plants and Fungi was established under the Ministry of Nature of Russia, the Commission comprises special sections and 
working groups of experts</p>
<p>In 1994 the Commission considered results of the work done and recommended to the Ministry of Nature of Russia to commence formal 
procedures of agreement with administrations of subjects of the Russian Federation and interested federal executive agencies of the 
list of fauna objects to be included in the Red Data Book and three proposals that are not covered by the jurisdiction of the Red Data 
Book Agreement of the list with over 90 subjects of the Russian Federation and federal ministries and agencies took approximately two 
years In parallel, work on development of regulatory legal acts ensuring maintenance of the Red Data Book, monitoring and protection 
of objects included in it, was done.</p>
<p>It was taken into consideration that the national Red Data Book includes objects requiring special federal-level protection measures 
These measures must ensure inter aha control and meeting of international obligations of Russia for the conservation of these objects, 
coordination of state measures between subjects of the Russian Federation and state control over conservation of an object living at 
the territory of only one subject of the Russian Federation if its extinction at this territory results in loss of this object from 
fauna of Russia</p>
<p>The Red Data Book of the Russian Federation includes six categories of rareness of taxons and populations depending on the hazard of 
their extinction 0 - probably extinct, 1 - endangered, 2 - decreasing in number, 3 - rare, 4 - status undetermined, 5 - rehabilitating 
and being rehabilitated.</p>

<p>The "probably extinct" category includes taxons and populations about which there is information that they lived at the territory 
(aquatory) of the Russian Federation, but which presence in nature has not been confirmed for invertebrates - for the last 100 years, 
for vertebrates - for the last 50 years The "endangered" category unites taxons and populations which number has decreased to a 
critical level so that in the near future they can become extinct The "decreasing in number" category includes taxons and populations 
which number is steadily decreasing and that may in the shortest time period join the "endangered" category The "rare" category 
includes taxons and populations that are small in number and/or spread at a limited territory (aquatory) or sporadically spread at 
significant territories (aquatories) The "undetermined status" category includes taxons and populations that require special 
protection measures but in relation to which there are currently no sufficient data or available data do not fully comply with 
criteria of all other categories The "rehabilitating and being rehabilitated" category includes taxons and populations the number and 
spreading of which under influence of natural causes or in the result of protection measures taken have begun to rehabilitate and are 
nearing the condition when they will not need prompt measures aimed at protection and rehabilitation.</p>
<p>Taking into consideration diversity of fauna and the scale of the territory of Russia, the revision of the environmental status and 
fauna representatives rarity categories was carried out on the basis of consultations with specialists of over 70 institutions of the 
Russian Academy of Sciences and other leading central and regional research and higher educational institutions The large number and 
extremely poor coverage of studies of species of invertebrates, practical difficulty in their identification by employees of 
environmental agencies predetermined the possibility of including into the Red Data Book only forms related to the first three 
categories, and first of all largest and most popular species that often become objects of excessive interest of collectors
In addition to the mam section (that includes essays on condition of species of animals included in the Red Data Book of the Russian 
Federation, the essays are arranged in a systematic order), the Red Data Book includes three appendixes:</p>
<ol>
<li> The annotated list of taxons and populations excluded from the Red Data Book of the Russian Federation It includes taxons and 
populations, data on rehabilitation of the number and (or) natural habitats of which, as well as on positive changes in conditions of 
their existence, confirm that there is no necessity to take prompt measures aimed at their protection and reproduction</li>
<li> The annotated list of taxons and populations of the world fauna that became extinct in the Russian Federation It includes those 
animals about which there is information that they lived at the territory (aquatory) of Russia beginning from the middle of the 
eighteenth century, but data on existence of which have not been received for the last 100 years (for invertebrates) and 50 years (for 
vertebrates)</li>
<li> The annotated list of taxons and populations requiring special attention to their state in natural environment They include those 
taxons and populations, data on number and ranges of which, as well as on conditions of their existence, confirm that at present there 
is no need to take special measures aimed at their protection and reproduction at the federal level, but because of limited 
distribution or other biological peculiarities these taxons and populations are vulnerable and these measures may be necessary This 
list also includes taxons and populations included in the IUCN Red List, Red Lists of Europe and Asia, the state of which at the 
territory (aquatory) of Russia don't require special measures aimed at their protection</li>
</ol>
<p>In contrast to the mam section, the above appendixes are not legal documents and their objective is to attract attention of 
environmental and scientific community to state of populations of species of animals listed in them</p>
<p>Over 100 specialists of agencies under the Russian Academy of Sciences, State Committee for Environment Protection of Russia, 
zapovedniks, other central and regional scientific institutions and higher educational institutes participated in preparation of 
essays on species</p>
<p>A N Severtsov Institute of Ecology and Evolution of the Russian Academy of Sciences performed large organizational work on preparation 
of the final version and ensuring publication of the Red Data Book of the Russian Federation The Editorial Board and essay authors

<h4>Editorial Board</h4>
<p>Dr A A Varshavsky prepared electronic versions of maps of ranges on the basis of originals submitted by authors of essays on species 
Maps of ranges use the Kavraisky s standard conic equidistant projection A range of a species in Russia is shown in red, red dots 
indicate places where a species was encountered, question mark indicates an unreliable encounter of a species in this place red dotted 
line shows the border of a range of a species in the past In the section "Birds" the winter part of a range of a species in Russia is 
shown in green, places of overlapping of nesting and winter parts of a range are shown in brown</p>
