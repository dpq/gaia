<h3>PREFACE</h3>
<p>Spontaneous development of the human civilization has been accompanied by a continuously growing impact on the environment. In the twentieth century the pressure on the Earth's biosphere, accompanied by destruction of natural ecosystems and growing pollution has reached alarming levels. Along with anthropogenic processes such as increasing concentration of greenhouse gases and thinning of the ozone stratum, these hazardous tendencies also include desertification, downsizing of forests and biological diversity.</p>

<p>Anthropogenic pressure on the Earth's biosphere has led to a dangerously high rate of extinction of animal, plant and fungus species. The hazard of biological diversity downsizing is often viewed from the economic point of view (downsizing of the genetic pool decreases the opportunities in the area of biotechnology development), or is based on ethical, esthetic, social and paedagogic principles. These are very important aspects, but a more important aspect is that biodiversity downsizing is a sign of biota degradation, destruction of environmental balance, danger of destruction of natural environment stabilization mechanisms, and a possibility of an environmental catastrophe.</p>

<p>Preservation of the genetic pool of living beings (first and foremost endangered species, i.e. the most vulnerable portion of biota) is one of the main tasks of environment protection. In accordance with current legislation, rare and endangered species of animals, plants and fungi are included in the Red Data Books of the Russian Federation and its subjects. Inclusion of a species in the Red Data Book is a legal act, imposing constraints on the relevant species as an object of legal protection from other representatives of flora and fauna. The legal guarranties dedicated to improving the possibilities of species conservation and rehabilitation are applied to all species included in the Red Data Book.</p>

<p>Maintenance of the Red Data Book of the Russian Federation is a continuous work on monitoring rare and endangered species and on implementation of the above organizational and legal guarranties. The present edition summarizes this work for the last fifteen years after its first edition.</p>

<p>The Red Data Book of the Russian Federation also plays a significant role as a popular scientific reference. It includes data on  aspects of biology of rare and endangered species that reflect the reasons for their rareness or extinction, constraints that substantiate these phenomena, and activities that facilitate conservation of these species. It is worth noting that conservation of rare and endangered species (and equally species that are fortunately not currently endangered) is possible only in case of preservation, rehabilitation and expansion of the ecosystems where they live, natural elements of which they are and to which their genetic programs are oriented.</p>

<p>The proposed edition is a result of joint work by many scientists and highly-qualified specialists of central and regional scientific institutions, as well as universities and legislative and executive authorities.</p>

<p>The Red Data Book of the Russian Federation includes rare and endangered animals, plants and fungi that permanently or temporarily live under conditions of natural freedom at the territory, continental shelf and in the naval economic zone of the Russian Federation, and that need special governmental legal activities within competence of federal executive authorities. The Red Data Book of the Russian Federation fullfills the obligations of the Russian Federation assumed in accordance with the Rio-de-Janeiro Convention on Biological Diversity approved in 1992.</p>

<p>The Red Data Book of the Russian Federation that includes fauna objects (the Red Data Book of RSFSR) was initially published in 1983. The Department of Hunting and Protected Areas under the Council of Ministers of the Russian Federation (Glavokhota RSFSR) prepared and published this edition. The Central Hunting and Protected Areas Research Laboratory of Glavokhota RSFSR (CNIL Glavokhota RSFSR, presently State Agency "Control Information and Analytical Center for Hunted Animals and Their Habitats" of the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Supplies of Russia) with involvement of zoologists of Russian academic and leading research institutions provided scientific support.</p>

<p>According to the the applicable civil law, the Red Data Book should be published at least once in ten years. Compilation and concordance of lists of fauna objects to be included in the Red Data Book resumed almost immediately after the initial release of the Red Data Book of RSFSR in 1983. CNIL Glavokhota RSFSR collected a considerable part of materials for preparation of essays on species for the Red Data Book. Further developments in the country introduced significant changes in the commenced work. Preparation of the final version of the Red Data Book of the Russian Federation and its publication were conducted by A. N. Severtsov (Institute of Ecology and Evolution of the Russian Academy of Sciences).</p>

<p>After establishing a system of environmental agencies in 1988, responsibility for maintaining the Red Data Book of the Russian Federation was transferred to the Ministry of Nature of Russia. The Russian Academy of Sciences and the Russian Research Institute of Nature Protection provide it with scientific support. In 1992 Commission for Rare and Endangered Animals, Plants and Fungi was established with the Ministry of Nature of Russia. The Commission is comprised of special sections and expert working groups of.</p>

<p>In 1994 the Commission reviewed the produced results and recommended the Ministry of Nature of Russia to commence formal procedures of agreement of the list of fauna objects to be included in the Red Data Book and three proposals that are not covered by the jurisdiction of the Red Data Book with local administration of subjects of the Russian Federation and relevant federal executive agencies. The process of verification and agreement of the list with over 90 subjects of the Russian Federation and federal ministries and agencies took approximately two years. Meanwhile, development of regulatory legal acts ensuring maintenance of the Red Data Book, monitoring and protection of objects included in it reached completion.</p>

<p>It was taken into consideration that the national Red Data Book includes objects requiring special federal-level protection measures. These measures must ensure international control and compliance with international obligations of Russia for the conservation of these objects, coordination of governmental measures between subjects of the Russian Federation, and state control over conservation of objects unique to territory of a single subject of the Russian Federation.</p>

<p>The Red Data Book of the Russian Federation includes six categories of rareness of taxons and populations depending on the hazard of their extinction: 0 - probably extinct, 1 - endangered, 2 - decreasing in number, 3 - rare, 4 - status undetermined, 5 - rehabilitating and being rehabilitated.</p>

<p>The "probably extinct" category includes taxons and populations which are known to have lived at the territory (aquatory) of the Russian Federation, but whose presence in nature has not been confirmed recently (during the last 100 years for invertebrates, and during the last 50 years for vertebrates). The "endangered" category unites taxons and populations whose numbers have decreased to a critical level so that in the near future they can become extinct. The "decreasing in number" category includes taxons and populations whose numbers are steadily decreasing and may in the shortest time period join the "endangered" category. The "rare" category includes taxons and populations that either are small in number, or spread over a limited territory (aquatory), or spread over significant territories (aquatories) only sporadically. The "undetermined status" category includes taxons and populations that require special protection measures, however the relevant available data is insufficient or doesn't fully comply with the criteria for the other categories. The "rehabilitating and being rehabilitated" category includes taxons and populations, whose numbers and spread have begun to rehabilitate under the influence of natural causes or due to the protection measures taken, and are nearing the condition when they will not need prompt measures aimed at protection and rehabilitation.</p>

<p>Taking into consideration diversity of fauna and the scale of the Russian territory, revision of environmental status and fauna  rarity categories was carried out on the basis of consultations with specialists of over 70 institutions of the Russian Academy of Sciences and other leading central and regional research and educational institutions. The large number and extremely poor coverage of invertebrates and practical difficulties in their identification by employees of environmental agencies forced to include into the Red Data Book only the species belonging to the first three categories, especially the large and notable species that often become the target of collectors' excessive interest.</p>

<p>In addition to the main section that is comprised of essays on the condition of species included in the Red Data Book of the Russian Federation, the Red Data Book includes three appendixes:</p>
<ol>
<li> The annotated list of taxons and populations excluded from the Red Data Book of the Russian Federation. It includes taxons and populations, data on whose rehabilitation, numbers and natural habitats confirm that there is no necessity to take prompt measures aimed at their protection and reproduction.</li>
<li> The annotated list of taxons and populations of the world fauna that have become extinct in the Russian Federation. It includes  animals that are known to have lived at the territory (aquatory) of Russia as late as the second half of the eighteenth century, but data on whose existence has not been received for the last 100 years (for invertebrates) and 50 years (for vertebrates).</li>
<li> The annotated list of taxons and populations requiring special attention to their state in natural environment. They include those taxons and populations that at present do not required to take special measures aimed at their protection and reproduction at the federal level according to the data available on their count and range, but because of their limited distribution or other biological peculiarities these taxons and populations are vulnerable and these measures may become necessary in the future. This list also includes taxons and populations included in the IUCN Red List and Red Lists of Europe and Asia, whose state at the territory (aquatory) of Russia does not require special measures aimed at their protection.</li>
</ol>

<p>In contrast to the main section, the above appendixes are not legal documents and their objective is to attract attention of the environmental and scientific community to the state of populations of species of animals listed in them.</p>

<p>Over 100 specialists of agencies under the Russian Academy of Sciences, State Committee for Environment Protection of Russia, natural reserves, other central and regional scientific institutions and educational facilities participated in the preparation of the essays in the main section.</p>

<p>A.N.Severtsov Institute of Ecology and Evolution of the Russian Academy of Sciences has performed large organizational work on preparation of the final version and ensuring publication of the Red Data Book of the Russian Federation.

<h4>Editorial Board</h4>
<p>Dr. A.A.Varshavsky prepared electronic versions of range maps based on submissions by authors of essays on species.
Range maps use the Kavraisky's standard conic equidistant projection. A range of a species in Russia is shown in red, red dots indicate locations where a species was encountered; a question mark indicates an unreliable encounter of a species in this location; red dotted line indicates historical range borders. In the "Birds" section the winter part of a range in Russia is shown in green, areas with overlapping of nesting and winter range parts are shown in brown.</p>
