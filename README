To whoever reads this: the author of these lines David Parunakian aka Rumith is in no way responsible
for the abomination that is the GUI of this software product!
It has been designed and enforced by the V.Prisyajnyuk, who probably damned his immortal soul in process.

Code to be developed and supported:
config[.h|.cpp]
core[.h|.cpp]

Config is responsible for loading configuration files formatted not unlike Microsoft INI files.
Core contains GaiaCore, the basis for developing a full-scale biological data mining and analysis system.


Files hacked together during a couple of hours so the above-mentioned GUI works:
main.cpp
uiloader[.h|.cpp]
stack[.h|.cpp]

I will of course accept bug reports for these, too - just don't expect a superb quality from them.


Sincerely yours,

Jaffar Pharun Rumith
