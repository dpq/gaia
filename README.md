This software was initially written in 2008-2009 specifically for the Red Data Book lab
of the Russian VNIIPRIRODI biosphere research institute.

The project director and me had different points of view on many points, from
GUI decisions to technical constraints. This fact is partially responsible for quite a
lot of poor architectural decisions and interface.

Now that over 5 years have passed, I finally decided to salvage what can be salvaged,
rewrite what cannot and produce a version of this program that would not be absolutely
disgusting to use or read.

I now consider this project complete. Feel free to open issues on the rare chance that
this stuff might be of actual use to someone or you have a habit of hunting bugs in
obscure pieces of software.
